yelp-review-analysis
====================

Repository containing script on how I processed and charted Yelp data. This is a complement to the blog post [The Statistical Difference Between 1-Star and 5-Star Reviews on Yelp](http://minimaxir.com/2014/09/one-star-five-stars/).

Since Yelp prohibits redistribution of the data, I've left this code here to give an idea how I parsed the data and created the charts.
